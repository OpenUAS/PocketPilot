# PocketPilot
PocketPilot boards are smaller versions of the BBBmini PCB (https://github.com/mirkix/BBBMINI), designed for use with PocketBeagle (https://beagleboard.org/pocket, a small version of BeagleBone Black). It provides a very small & light-weight open-source ArduPilot based autopilot / flight controller for quadcopter drones & robots.

There will be several different versions of the PocketPilot board coming out over time:

* **PocketPilot v1** (DIY design, early 2018): Only uses through-hole components & connectors, with Chinese sensor modules plugged in. Since it doesn't need any SMD soldering, you are expected to build it yourself using traditional solder by following our instructions. Basically it's a BBBmini for the PocketBeagle computer instead of for BeagleBone Black.
* **PocketPilot v2** (mid 2018): Similar to PocketPilot v1 but uses JST-GH connectors, and for people that can't do any soldering themselves. It can be ordered from Shervin in Australia, or soldered yourself if you are willing to solder a few SMD connectors.
* **PocketPilot v3** (late 2018): A small & lightweight single board containing SMD parts and JST-GH connectors and no Chinese sensor modules, manufactured by a PCBA service in China and ordered from China.

PocketPilot v1 (based on BBBmini https://github.com/mirkix/BBBMINI-PCB) can be soldered by hand by most people since it only uses large "through-hole" components and common "Dupont" servo wiring connectors. However, it's quite big & heavy compared to the small PocketBeagle, and the connectors can potentially have a loose connection when on a moving robot or quadcopter, and also not everyone wants to solder their own electronics. So PocketPilot v3 will be using tiny SMD components, reliable SMD connectors, and available as a pre-soldered kit. All PocketPilot boards are open-source hardware, just like BBBMini, but most people will only be capable of soldering v1 and maybe v2.
