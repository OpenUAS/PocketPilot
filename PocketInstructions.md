# POCKET BEAGLE INSTALLATION

## LOADING IMAGE:
Using Etcher or Win32DiskImager, make a SSD (16 GB) using this image file:
 https://debian.beagleboard.org/images/bone-debian-9.2-iot-armhf-2017-10-10-4gb.img.xz

## CONNECT & SHARE
Insert ssd and connect the micro USB to a windows based computer.
The "USB-tether-gadget", allows you to bridge and share the Ethernet Network Devices to acces Internet:
Read the Instruction on how to connect here:
https://www.digikey.com/en/maker/blogs/how-to-connect-a-beaglebone-black-to-the-internet-using-usb/cdf66181b3a5436e9ad730e4ed4cf9ee

As described in the above,  you need to create a route:
`sudo /sbin/route add default gw 192.168.7.1`

NOTE: On the new image we cannot add  name server to the resolv file,
we need to create a temporary config file:
`sudo nano /etc/resolv.conf`
`nameserver 8.8.8.8`
Remember that you have to add route and recreate `/etc/resolv.conf` at each reboot.

You can test that the route is working by issuing `ping google.com`
And get a response like that
```
PING google.com (172.217.6.206) 56(84) bytes of data.
64 bytes from lga25s54-in-f14.1e100.net (172.217.6.206): icmp_seq=1 ttl=51 time= 20.2 ms
```
A special note about FIREWALLS:  make sure your firewall is configured to  allow  a share connection !!

## UPDATING AND LOADING:
`sudo apt update`
`sudo apt upgrade bb-cape-overlays`

Get the configuration file:
`sudo wget https://github.com/PocketPilot/PocketPilot/tree/master/config/pocketpilot_pin.cfg`

Extend partition: 
`sudo /opt/scripts/tools/grow_partition.sh`
Upgrade Kernel to RT 4.14:
`sudo /opt/scripts/tools/update_kernel.sh --bone-rt-kernel --lts-4_14`

Removing some unused packages:
`sudo apt remove haveged bonescript c9-core-installer roboticscape bb-node-red-installer --purge`

Shutdown apache2 (we dont use it):
`sudo systemctl disable apache2`

REBOOT AND TEST
`sudo reboot`
 
Confirm the New kernel:
`uname -a`
`Linux beaglebone 4.14.11-bone-rt-r12 #1 PREEMPT RT Wed Jan 3 23:08:51 UTC 2018 armv7l GNU/Linux`

Confirm file system has been extended:
```df
Filesystem 		1K-blocks	 Used 		Available 	Use% 
/dev/mmcblk0p1 	15247576 	1739372 	12837360 	12% /
```

Check SPI correctly mapped (without adding a DTB):
```ls /dev/spi*
/dev/spidev0.0 /dev/spidev1.0 /dev/spidev1.1
```

Check the serial ports as well (dont forget its the letter "O"):
```ls /dev/ttyO*
/dev/ttyO0 /dev/ttyO1 /dev/ttyO2 /dev/ttyO4
```

Check that boot environment include the universal cape (used to map IO):
```cat /boot/uEnv.txt
uname_r=4.14.11-bone-rt-r12
enable_uboot_overlays=1
uboot_overlay_pru=/lib/firmware/AM335X-PRU-RPROC-4-4-TI-00A0.dtbo
enable_uboot_cape_universal=1
cmdline=coherent_pool=1M net.ifnames=0 quiet
```
Note: only the ''active" commands are showned.

You can check on the loaded services using
`sudo systemctl status`
or
`sudo systemctl list-dependencies`


## WIFI CONNECTION

OPTION A) CONNMAN 
Use it as a client connected to an Access Point.
In that case connman is already loaded and ready to use.
Configuring connman
```
sudo connmanctl
connmanctl> tether wifi disable
connmanctl> enable wifi
connmanctl> scan wifi
connmanctl> services
connmanctl> agent on
connmanctl> connect wifi_*_managed_psk ==> this is your access point
//Your are asked to enter your key//
connmanctl> quit
```
Once configure the service will be automatically started


OPTION B) HOSTAPD
Use it as an Access Point,  on which you can connect yoy PC or Tablet.
==============================================================
Please note that not all chipsets can act as an Acces Point, 
take a look at the column AP =Yes: 
https://wireless.wiki.kernel.org/en/users/Drivers

This is the short list of the AP chipset:
Driver	    Manufacturer	   PHY modes
ath9k_htc	 Atheros	        B/G/N
carl9170	  ZyDAS/Atheros	  A(1)/B/G/N
libertas_tfMarvell	        B/G
p54usb	    Intersil/Conexant	A(1)/B/G
rt73usb	   Ralink	        A(1)/B/G
rt2500usb	 Ralink	        A(1)/B/G
rt2800usb	Ralink	         A(1)/B/G/N
rtl8192cu	Realtek	        B/G/N
zd1211rw	 ZyDAS/Atheros	  A(2)/B/G
==============================================================


First disable connman:
`sudo systemctl disable connman`
Then update tools:
`sudo apt-get install hostapd dnsmasq iptables iw wireless-tools`


Check the wifi dongle number with 
`ifconfig -a`
and confirm wlan0 or wlan1 or else

Manually start the wireless card
`sudo ifconfig wlan0 up`

Confirm its up 
`ifconfig`
You should see the Wlan interface with the others


Now edit network files:
`sudo nano /etc/network/interfaces and add the wifi config (with wlan-number)`
```
auto wlan0
iface wlan0 inet static
hostapd /etc/hostapd/hostapd.conf
address 192.168.8.1
netmask 255.255.255.0
```

Then edit the hostapd.conf file: 
`sudo nano /etc/hostapd/hostapd.conf`
```
interface=wlan0
driver=nl80211
ssid=Pocket-Pilot
channel=1
ignore_broadcast_ssid=0
country_code=US
ieee80211d=1
hw_mode=g
macaddr_acl=0
max_num_sta=10
auth_algs=1
ignore_broadcast_ssid=0
rsn_preauth=1
rsn_preauth_interfaces=wlan0
wpa=3
wpa_passphrase=MINIMUM_8_CHARACTERS
wpa_key_mgmt=WPA-PSK
wpa_pairwise=TKIP
rsn_pairwise=CCMP
```

Finaly make a new dnsmasq.conf file
make a copy of existing 
`sudo mv /etc/dnsmasq.conf /etc/dnsmasq.bkup`

create new file
`sudo nano /etc/dnsmasq.conf`
```
interface=lo,wlan0
no-dhcp-interface=lo
dhcp-range=192.168.8.20,192.168.8.40,255.255.255.0,12h

interface=usb0
dhcp-range=192.168.7.1,192.168.7.1,12h
```

ENABLE THE SERVICES
`sudo systemctl enable networking`
`sudo systemctl enable hostapd`

You can now reboot
`sudo reboot`

While monitoring the WIFI from the Windows PC, the ssid=Pocket-Pilot should appear within in a minute
Connect to Pocket-Pilot using the wpa_passphrase 
open a ssh session (Putty)
log on to 192.168.8.1
and voil√† ;-)


## ARDUPILOT
Make Firmware as per BBBMINI instructions:
https://github.com/mirkix/BBBMINI/blob/master/doc/software/software.md
and build using pocket profile:
`/waf configure --board=pocket`

copy file in /home/debian

### PIN CONFIGURE
The new kernel is now using uboot overlays 
https://elinux.org/Beagleboard:BeagleBoneBlack_Debian#U-Boot_Overlays

All the I/O are configured from user space using config-pin utility
This utility can use a parameter file to automatically configure the Beagle Pocket
(We have downloaded this configuration file on previous step)
This is how its launched manually:
`sudo config-pin -f ./pocketpilot_pin.cfg`

And this will be launched automatically as part of the arducopter service


## ARDUCOPTER SERVICE
We will edit a file containing instructions to load the pins and ArduCopter

`sudo nano /lib/systemd/system/arducopter.service`
```
[Unit]
Description=ArduCopter Service
After=networking.service
Conflicts=arduplane.service ardupilot.service ardurover.service

[Service]
ExecStartPre=/bin/bash -c "/usr/bin/config-pin -f /home/debian/pocketpilot_pin.cfg"
ExecStart=/home/debian/arducopter -C udp:192.168.8.34:14550 -E /dev/ttyO1

Restart=on-failure

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

ENABLE THE NEW SERVICE
`sudo systemctl enable arducopter.service`
the service will start automatically at bootup.



SERVICE RELATED UTILITIES
If you want to start/stop this service (or any other services):
Start service: `systemctl start {SERVICENAME}`
`sudo systemctl start arducopter.service`
Stop service: `systemctl stop {SERVICENAME}`
`sudo systemctl stop arducopter.service`

`sudo systemctl status`
`sudo systemctl list-dependencies`
